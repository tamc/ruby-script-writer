= RubyScriptWriter

RubyScriptWriter helps programatically create new ruby scripts:

r = RubyScriptWriter.new
r.put_class "One" do
  r.put_method "a", "arg1","arg2" do
    r.puts "return arg1 + arg2"
  end
end
puts r

class One
  def a(arg1,arg2)
    return arg1 + arg2
  end

end

It can be installed as a gem:
gem install rubyscriptwriter
